This is implementation of "object prevalence system" AKA Prevayler in Python.

See this site for ideas description http://prevayler.org/

SOURCE

'pv' is root package
'pv.ext' is package that contains some utilities that extend prevayler's functionality.
src/pv/example.py is usage example.

TESTING

There are Python unit tests in source tree. Since the project is tiny, unittests
are usually in same file as main code.
You may use python-nose to run all unit tests. See it's homepage
http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/
Ubuntu has package for it python-nose:
    sudo apt-get install python-nose
To run tests cd to project's root and
	nosetests --all-modules
Eclipse's PyDev also can run all tests in project: select project in project explorer
and from context menu choose "Run As / Python unit-test".
